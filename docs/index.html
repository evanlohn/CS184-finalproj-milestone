<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Our project goal is to adapt Project 3 to simulate and render watercolor-like graphics on 3D objects.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Progress</h2>
  <p> So far, we have decided what paper(s) to base our work on, and the general idea for how we will implement the watercolor simulation and rendering within the framework of project 3-1. The main challenges we had were that project 3-1 has no built-in code for simulation, and we had to decide how to store and later render our simulation results. To solve this, we added another class on the same level of abstraction as the pathracer whose sole purpose is to perform the simulation of watercolor brush strokes and store the results in the half-ege mesh representing the scene objects. We plan to modify the definition of a bsdf to allow for objects in the scene to have a different bsdf at different points to allow for the results of our watercolor brush simulation to be reflected during object rendering. </p>

<h2 align="middle">Progress and Plan</h2>
  <p> Unfortunately we haven't written enough code to get any new-looking results. This means we are very behind schedule. So, we'll be spending the next few days working towards developing the simulation, and then the days leading up to the deadline making it look nice and easy to use.<p>
